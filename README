rtl-trx: Transmit and receive RTTY using an RTL-SDR dongle

Local oscillator leakage from an RTL-SDR dongle can be used as a very low power
FSK transmitter. This program transmits RTTY and also makes it easy to use the
same dongle to receive RTTY in between transmissions.


Setup:

Install fldigi, pavucontrol, liquiddsp and librtlsdr
( https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp https://github.com/keenerd/rtl-sdr )

Run make to compile the program.

Run ./pulseaudio_pipe.sh (only once after starting your computer).

Start fldigi and pavucontrol.

Go to Recording tab in pavucontrol and set fldigi to
capture from "Unix FIFO source /tmp/audiopipe".

In fldigi menu: Op Mode -> RTTY -> custom, go to Tx tab. Choose these settings:
425 Carrier shift, 45.45 Baud rate, 5 Bits per character,
none Parity, 2 Stop bits.

Start rtl-trx:
./rtl-trx 3>/tmp/audiopipe

You should now see noise scrolling in the waterfall of fldigi.
rtl-trx is working as an upper sideband demodulator which sends the demodulated
audio to fldigi. You can change your dial frequency by typing letter F and a
number into rtl-trx. For example, F 435e6 lets you receive 435 MHz USB.

Now you can also type a line of text into rtl-trx and it should be transmitted
as RTTY with a shift of 439.45 Hz.
